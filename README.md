Motionless.Data.Persistence
================
This software has currently an alpha status. Use it on your own risk. I use it at the moment in an new application not ready for production yet.

Motionless.Data.Persistence provides a small helper toolkit for NHibernate.
It contains a PersistenceHelper to handle transactions and session as a PersistenceContext for datebase access.
It also contains a generic base class BaseObject<T>.
